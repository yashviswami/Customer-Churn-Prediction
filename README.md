1. Project Overview:
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is critical for subscription-based businesses as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The project involves using a publicly available Telco Customer Churn dataset that contains customer demographic information, service details, and engagement metrics. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on these features.

2. Directory Structure:
The project is organized into a clear directory structure to facilitate easy understanding and collaboration:

bash
Copy code
Customer-Churn-Prediction/
├── data/
│   └── telco.csv              # Raw dataset
├── notebooks/
│   └── churn_prediction.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for analysis and model training
├── src/
│   └── churn_prediction.py     # Python script for model development
├── requirements.txt            # File for Python dependencies
└── README.md                   # Project description and instructions
Explanation of Each Directory/File:
data/telco.csv:

This is the raw dataset containing customer data, including customer demographics, service details, account information, and a binary target variable indicating whether the customer churned (Yes or No).
Columns might include features such as customer age, tenure (how long they’ve been subscribed), monthly charges, service usage, and payment methods.
notebooks/churn_prediction.ipynb:

This Jupyter Notebook allows you to interactively explore the data, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and build and evaluate the model step by step.
It’s a great place for quick data analysis, visualizations, and testing hypotheses.
You can use this to understand the underlying patterns of churn, visualize relationships between features, and tweak the model interactively.
src/churn_prediction.py:

This is the main Python script where all the processing happens. It performs the following tasks:
Data Loading: Loads the dataset from the provided file.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, one-hot encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
Model Building: Trains a Random Forest Classifier model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model using metrics like the Classification Report and ROC-AUC score, and generates an ROC Curve to visualize performance.
The script can be executed from the command line or integrated into any pipeline for automated predictions.
requirements.txt:

This file lists all the Python libraries required to run the project. It simplifies the setup process for other developers or data scientists who want to reproduce your work.

README.md:

The README.md file is a markdown file that provides an overview of the project, explains how to set up and run it, and describes the contents of the repository.
It is a critical part of any GitHub project as it provides context to users and collaborators about what the project does and how to use it.

# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Files:
- `data/telco.csv`: Raw dataset containing customer information.
- `notebooks/churn_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analysis and model training.
- `src/churn_prediction.py`: Python script to preprocess data, train, and evaluate the model.

3. Step-by-Step Overview of the Python Script (churn_prediction.py):
Data Loading:

The script begins by loading the dataset using pandas.read_csv() from a file path.
It prints basic information about the dataset, such as column names, data types, and any missing values.
Data Preprocessing:

Missing Values: The script handles missing data by filling numerical columns with the median value.
Churn Column Encoding: The Churn column is transformed from text values (Yes/No) to binary values (1/0) using map().
Categorical Data Encoding: It uses One-Hot Encoding (pd.get_dummies()) to convert categorical columns into binary features.
Feature Scaling:

The script applies Standard Scaling to normalize numerical features, ensuring that all features are on a similar scale, which improves model performance.
Model Building:

RandomForestClassifier is used as the machine learning model for predicting churn.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
The model is trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Classification Report: This report provides various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (churned vs. non-churned customers).
ROC-AUC Curve: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted, showing the model's true positive rate versus false positive rate.
AUC Score: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) score is calculated to summarize the overall model performance.
